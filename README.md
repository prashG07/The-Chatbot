Here I used the BeautifulSoup (Web Scrapping Tool) to extract the data from the website that I created before. Then I used the ‘if else’ statements to simply serve the data as per the users requirements. Also I used the ‘print’ function to interact a bit with the user.

Challenges :
Initially I planned to work with some sort of APIs available but was unable to find an much useful one. I also tried the IMDB API but was unsuccessful at the end.
So then I decided to shift to the web scraping which worked perfectly.

Learnings For the Future:
Working on this project helped me to learn new skills like Web scraping and using APIs.

And these wonderful skills I believe will be very helpful to me in future ventures and infact I am really motivated to build the Library Buddy for the University using these skills.
